            <img class="centeredimg" src="regions.png">

            <p>There are 5 major regions in Lithuania:</p>
            <ol id="geolist">
                <li>Lithuania Minor (Mažoji Lietuva)</li>
                    <p class="geop">The majority of this historical regional is now contained within the Russian
                        exclave of Kaliningrad. It was once part of Prussia and German speaking Lithuanians
                        lived there. A section of the region is still part of the republic of Lithuania today.
                    </p>
                <li>Samogitia (Žemaitija)</li>
                    <p class="geop">Samogitia is a lowland region known for its distinct dialect and ties with the cultural
                        reawakening of the Lithuanian people following independence from the Russian Empire.
                        Samogitians were the last pagan peoples of Europe, and were in conflict with the
                        Teutonic Order until defeating them at the battle of Grunwald in 1410.
                    </p>
                <li>Aukštaitija</li>
                    <p class="geop">This is known as Lithuania's highlands, despite not being very high at all relative to
                        other countries. The main city in this region is Panevėžys.
                    </p>
                <li>Suvalkija</li>
                    <p class="geop">This is the smallest of the cultural regions and sits on the border with Poland.
                        Due to the early abolition of serfdom, fertile land and close economic ties with East
                        Prussia, the residents of the region have a stereotype of being very rational, clever,
                        extremely frugal and even greedy. 
                     </p>
                <li>Dzūkija</li>
                    <p class="geop">This region contains the capital city, Vilnius. There is also significant numbers of
                         Polish speaking peoples and Belorussians. The are is home to the Dzūkija National Park,
                         which contains the largest forest in Lithuania, as well as Trakai Castle.
                     </p>
